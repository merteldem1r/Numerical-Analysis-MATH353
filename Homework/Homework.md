## Submission Method

A runnable COLAB file must be uploaded to the homework submission area on Google Classroom. Each cell in the Colab file must be executed with outputs (graphs, printed results, etc.) displayed below. The submission area will automatically close after the specified date and time. Assignments will not be accepted via email or other methods.

## Assignment Description

To examine the Euler and Heun methods used in numerical solutions of first-order initial value problems in differential equations, both theoretically and practically, compare the results using Python, and interpret the differences in accuracy between the methods.

## Problem Definition

You will create three different differential equations of your choice and implement their solutions. You must create text areas in the Colab file for the theoretical parts and fill in the relevant sections.

## Content Requirements

The Colab file to be prepared must include the following:

1. Briefly explain the basic logic of the Euler method in your own words.
2. Explain how the Heun method provides an improvement over the Euler method.
3. Write the formulas for both methods explicitly.
4. Implement solutions for three equations using the Euler method with Python.
5. Implement solutions for three equations using the Heun method with Python.
6. Create tables showing x and y values for both methods.
7. Plot the solution curves for both methods on the same graph.
8. Axes, title, and legend must be clearly specified on the graph.
9. Interpret the differences between Euler and Heun methods based on numerical results.
10. Explain which method gives more accurate results and why it is more successful.
